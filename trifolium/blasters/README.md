# Blasters

One file per blaster, `blasters/<id>.json`: the config of a blaster built to a published design -
its settings and all three profiles. When the console connects to a board with no wiring, it asks
which board it is and then offers these configs, so someone who has built one from a kit can start
from the builders' settings rather than the firmware defaults.

The pins come from the board you pick, because a config saved on one board need not line up with
another's. Everything else comes from the config, including how the pusher is driven, which is not
a pin. A build wired differently from the board's usual pins is corrected in the Wiring tab after.

## Adding one

Set the blaster up and try it, then save **Backup > Full Backup** from the console and put the file
here, named for the blaster (`ophid2.json`). The name is its id. The console lists it by
`blasterName` and the board it was saved on - "Ophid 2 (built on Trifolium v1.4)" - so check both.

A file is written for one schema version, and the console refuses to load it onto firmware that
speaks another. After a release that changes the schema, update a blaster running the file to the
new firmware - it migrates its stored config - and save it again.

## Checking

```
python tests/checks/check_bundle.py
```

It checks every file against the schema. The console tests (`tests/suite/test_console.py`) also set
a simulated blaster up from each file and fail if the firmware changes any setting on the way in.
