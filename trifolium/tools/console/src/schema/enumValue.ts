 * Two kinds of node arrive with `kind: "enum"`, and they store their value differently.
 *
 * A node the firmware gave `optionValues` is backed by a C++ enum, and its config value is a
 * stable name ("esc_passthrough") rather than an ordinal - see the firmware's `enumIds.h`. The ids
 * are parallel to `options`, so moving between the two is a lookup.
 *
 * A node without `optionValues` stores a number, because there the number *is* the meaning: a fire
 * mode index, a profile index. Those use `lo` as the base, which matters for switch position
 * assignment - it stores -1 for "Default" (NO_FIRE_MODE) with mode indices from 0, so its options
 * list is one longer than its value span and everything is shifted by one.
