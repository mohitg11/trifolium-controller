// The wiring presets, and what applying one means.
//
// A board is a pin config preset and nothing more. The firmware has no board table any more, so
// there is no `LIST_BOARDS` to ask and no `SET_BOARD` to send: the console holds the presets, and
// applying one is an ordinary partial `LOAD_DEVICE`.
//
// They are compiled in, not fetched. The built page is one self-contained classic script that has
// to work from `file://`, where an opaque origin makes every fetch fail - so a presets folder
// sitting next to the HTML would break exactly the case the single-file build exists for.

// One folder per board, holding its wiring and its two drawings.
//
// There is no index naming them. The folders *are* the list, so adding a board is adding a folder
// and nothing else: no second place to register it, and no way to add one the console then
// silently does not offer.
//
// `import: "default"` matters: without it the glob hands back module namespace objects, and a
// namespace carries a `default` key of its own. That key would be filtered by nothing here and
// sent to the device as a setting, which the firmware would ignore - a mistake with no symptom
// until a real key collided with it.
const presetFiles = import.meta.glob<PresetFile>("../../../../boards/*/board.json", {
  eager: true,
  import: "default",
});
