// What the firmware will do with the pins in the table above, stated where somebody is typing them.
//
// These are documentation of rules that live in the firmware, so each one names where, and the two
// that are silicon rather than policy say so: a reader who does not believe the pin % 4 rule should
// be able to go and check it rather than take this file's word.
//
// Deliberately not derived from the schema. The schema publishes bounds, not consequences - there
// is no field on `device:batteryAdcPin` that says "anything outside 26-29 folds to unused", and a
// range narrowed to 26-29 would be the wrong fix (see AdcPinItem in menu.h for why). So this is
// prose, and it is short enough to keep true.
