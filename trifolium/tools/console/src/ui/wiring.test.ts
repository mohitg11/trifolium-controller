// The wiring half of MOH-10: the pins and five polarity flags belong to a Wiring section, and
// a resolved pin conflict has to be sayable in words the form uses for the same fields.
//
// Which pins there are is read out of the schema rather than listed here, and that is the property
// under test as much as the layout is. The console has gained no code per pin across three changes
// now - MOH-17's pusher gate and LED, then MOH-16's four ESC channels, the I2C pair, the battery
// ADC and the ESC-enable gate - because WiringTable matches on `display: "pin"`. A count written
// as a number would have to be edited each time, which is exactly the coupling this avoids.
