// The read-only visual counterpart to WiringTable: the same board, drawn instead of tabulated.

// Pin location comes entirely from the marker sheet -
// every element with a data-gpio attribute is a physical pin the console can label. Which control,
// if any, sits on that pin is a live fact read the same way WiringTable reads it: off the device
// payload, via the same collectWiring() rows, not duplicated here.
//
// Labels sit in columns either side of the board rather than on the pins, because pins are as close
// together as a connector's pitch - the ESC header puts six of them inside 120px of render - and a
// label naming a control is never that narrow. A leader line back to the pad is what buys the room.
//
// A pad can also carry a `data-label` the sheet's author wrote, and that is the only thing there is
// to say about a power pad - nothing is ever assigned to one, so without a label a supply pad can
// only ever answer "GND". Authored labels are drawn the same way but quieter, because the two answer
// different questions: what is wired here on this device, against what the pad is for on any of them.
//
// Pads that share a plug can say so with `data-connector`, usually on a <g> around them. Hovering
// any pad then lights the whole plug, and the connector's labels stack together. Until a sheet says
// otherwise this is guessed from the geometry, which is a good guess and only a guess - see runs().
