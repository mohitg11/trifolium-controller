// Curated presentation grouping for the config form.
//
// A deliberate change of stance, worth stating plainly: the schema remains the single source of
// truth for which fields exist, what they are called, and what values they accept. This file owns
// only *presentation* - what order sections appear in and which section a field is shown under.
//
// It exists because the firmware tree is shaped by the OLED's navigation, not by how someone thinks
// about a blaster. Shot-counter settings sit next to display brightness under "Device" because that
// is where they fit in a scrolling list, and the four motors are four submenus because a 128x64
// screen cannot show them side by side.
//
// The rule that keeps this honest: anything not claimed below still renders, in a trailing section.
// A field added in firmware can never silently disappear from the console because this file did not
// know about it.

/**
 * Fields the layout claims and deliberately does not render, because another component owns them.
 *
 * The trailing-section promise is that nothing added in firmware can silently disappear. A field
 * shown somewhere better would otherwise turn up twice - once where it belongs and once in "Other
 * settings" - so it is claimed here instead, with the place it went written down.
