  "profile:fireModes[*].targetDPS":
    "Darts per second to aim for, capped at what the pusher's timing can actually reach.",

    "How long after a press the release still fires. Released later, it counts as a new, separate pull.",
  "profile:fireModes[*].includeInCycle":
    "Whether the select button stops on this mode. Off keeps it in the list but out of the button's rotation.",

    "The mode used when no select line is grounded, such as a 3-way switch's middle position, and by any position left on Default.",
  "profile:switchPositionAssignment[*]":
    "The fire mode this select-switch or encoder position chooses. Default uses the profile's Default Mode.",

    "How the fire mode is chosen: a switch position, an encoder whose select lines count as a binary number, a button that cycles through modes, the on-screen picker only, or not at all.",

  // Flywheel and RPM
  "profile:rpmMode":

  "device:firingRPMTolerance":
    "How far below the target a motor may be and still count as at speed. Larger fires sooner into the spin-up.",

  "profile:speedPotStage2Ratio":
    "With a speed pot, stage 2's rev RPM as a multiple of stage 1's: 1.2 spins stage 2 20% faster. A single-stage blaster ignores it.",

    "On if the pot reads lower as it is turned up, so turning it up still means faster.",
  "device:rampupTimeout_ms":
    "If the flywheels are not at speed this long after a rev starts, the rev gives up and drops back to idle. Plasma is exempt.",
  "device:variableFPS":
    "With a switch or encoder select fire, the selector's position at power-on picks the profile, so one switch sets the FPS.",

    "The motor's Kv, in RPM per volt, from its spec sheet. With Battery Type it sets the limits of every RPM field for this motor.",

    "How the flywheels are held at their target RPM. PID is the standard choice; TBH (take-back-half) is an alternative.",
  "device:EMAFilter":
    "Smoothing on the RPM readings PID works from. Higher smooths more noise but reacts more slowly to real changes.",
  "device:iThreshold": "The PID integral term's tuning threshold.",
  "device:throttleCap":
    "Extra throttle TBH allows on the first rev, before its own feedback takes over.",
  "device:dshotMode": "The DShot rate the ESCs are driven at. Every ESC must support the rate chosen.",
  "device:useRpmLogging":
    "Records RPM against time on every rev, for the RPM Log tab. The blaster reboots after each capture, so turn it off for normal use.",
  "device:rpmLogLength": "How many samples a capture takes, one per millisecond, so 2000 is two seconds.",

  // Solenoid and pusher

  "device:pusherReverseDirection": "Flips the pusher motor's direction, for a motor wired backwards.",
  "device:dartSensing":
    "The pusher only pushes when the dart switch shows a dart, a new one each time, and pulls back as soon as that dart has gone. It never pushes an empty breech or the same dart twice.",
  "device:minPushTime_ms":
    "How long each push ignores the dart switch, since the pusher's jolt can make a dart look gone for a moment. After it, the pusher pulls back as soon as the switch reads empty. The extend time is still the longest a push lasts: set this at or above it to always push for the full time.",
  "device:dartWaitTimeout_ms":
    "How long a queued shot waits for a dart to arrive. When it runs out, the queued shots are dropped and the wheels follow the rev switch again.",
  "device:dartSwitchDebounce_ms":
    "How long the dart switch must show a dart without a break before it counts, for Dart Sensing and Rev Only With Dart alike. Higher rides out bounce and sensor noise; lower lets a dart fire sooner after it arrives.",
  "device:revOnlyWithDart":
    "A rev, from the rev switch or a trigger pull, only starts with a dart in the breech. Once the wheels are up, an empty breech doesn't stop them: they follow the rev switch as usual.",
  "device:pusherDebounceTime_ms": "Debounce for the pusher's own cycle-detection switch.",
  "device:solenoidRetractTime_ms":
    "How long the pusher takes to retract before the next shot. With the extend time, or Min Push while Dart Sensing is on, it sets the highest DPS any mode can reach.",

  "device:solenoidExtendTimeHighVoltage_mv": "The battery voltage from which the High V extend time applies.",
  "device:solenoidExtendTimeLow_ms":
    "A longer extend time for a sagging battery, so the push stays consistent as the solenoid weakens.",
  "device:solenoidExtendTimeLowVoltage_mv":
    "The battery voltage below which the Low V extend time applies. Between the two thresholds, the time is blended.",
  "device:vibrationPulseMs":
    "Length of the buzz Plasma gives for an armed dart or an overheat. Keep it short: it is meant to be felt, not to move a dart. 0 turns it off.",
  "device:pusherDrive":
    "Whether the pusher is driven by a FET or by one of the ESC channels. It depends on how your blaster is built, not only the board.",
  "device:pusherEscChannel":
    "Which ESC channel drives the pusher. That channel is then not available as a flywheel motor.",

  // Battery
  "device:batteryType":
    "Your pack's cell count. It scales the per-cell voltages below and sets every motor's RPM ceiling.",
  "device:lowVoltageCutoffPerCell_mv":
    "Below this voltage per cell the blaster refuses to spin up, to protect the pack.",
  "device:lowVoltageWarningPerCell_mv":
    "An earlier warning: LOW BATT blinks on the home screen, but you can still fire. Set it above the cutoff.",
  "device:voltageCalibrationFactor":
    "A correction for when the blaster's battery reading does not match a multimeter.",
  "device:voltageAveragingWindow":
    "How many battery readings are averaged. Higher steadies a jittery reading but reacts more slowly to a real drop.",

  // Wiring
  "device:boardId":
    "The board preset this wiring came from. For reference only: the blaster keeps it but never acts on it.",

  "device:escPins[*]": "The pin this motor's ESC signal wire is on.",

    "The pin of a switch or sensor that sees a dart sitting in the breech, ready to be pushed.",
  "device:dartSwitchNormallyClosed":
    "On if the dart switch opens, rather than closes to ground, when a dart is in the breech.",
  "device:speedPotPin":
    "The analog pin, GPIO 26 to 29, that reads a speed pot's wiper. With one wired, the pot sets the rev RPM in place of the profile's own.",

    "The pin of the safety switch. While it is engaged the blaster is in SAFE: no rev, no fire.",
  "device:select0Pin":
    "A select-switch pin. With a switch-type select fire each wired select pin is one switch position; with a button type, this one is the button.",
  "device:select1Pin":
    "A select-switch pin. With a switch-type select fire, each wired select pin is one switch position.",

  "device:ledWarningMode": "Which battery condition blinks the status LED.",

    "The trigger's two contact stages replace a separate rev switch: a light press revs, a full press fires. Plasma ignores the rev stage.",
